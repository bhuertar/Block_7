// 1. Add a variable associated with the value of the message
// 2. Add alert syntax with value inside 
// 3. Add a three variables associated with value of the vault number
// 4. Create arithmatic operators to equal the vault numbers
// 5. Test code as I proceed with assignment
// 4. Add comments for important steps

// Created a constant variable with the value of the message and alerted it
const vaultMessage = `You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault:`;

// Created variables associated to each number of the vault
const numOne = 100 / 10;
const numTwo = 20+20;
const numThree = 40-1;

// Created an alert with values of the vault message and vault numbers
alert(vaultMessage + " " + numOne + "-" + numTwo + "-" + numThree);
